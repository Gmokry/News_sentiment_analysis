# News_sentiment_analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) about the overall sentiment in news articles. 

Project written in Python that uses data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snapcrack/all-the-news to determine whether the language used in written press and articles tend to have a negative bias. This project uses some of the techniques learned during the first few weeks of the Data Science Bootcamp, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and some Natural Language Processing models that were researched outside the course, such as VADER, AFINN, TEXTBLOB and TRANSFORMERS with it's DistillBERT model. 

This work revolves around the null hypothesis that “media tend to use negative language in order to have greater impact in people”, and the approach tries to be as objective as possible, thus the use of NLP algorithms. 
Conclusions show that some of the models used, do detect a trend of negative news articles, whilst others, due to their limitations or their methodology, seem to detect fairly neutral scores.
